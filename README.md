**Dark Mode Toggle Theme Project**
This is a simple yet practical Dark Mode Toggle application built with JavaScript. It is a single-page project designed to demonstrate theme switching using a toggle button with clean and minimal logic.

**📝 What Does It Do?**
The Dark Mode Toggle is a web feature that allows users to switch between light mode and dark mode instantly. It improves user experience by offering a visually comfortable interface based on preference.

Theme Switching: Toggles between light and dark themes with a single click.

Dynamic UI Update: Changes background colors, text colors, and overall theme in real time.

User-Friendly Design: Provides a smooth and intuitive interaction through a toggle button.

**⚙️ How Does It Work?**
The project is based on DOM manipulation and conditional logic in JavaScript:

Theme Styles: Light and dark mode styles are defined using CSS classes or internal styles.

Element Selection: JavaScript selects the toggle button and main elements using querySelector or getElementById.

Toggle Logic: A click event listener checks the current theme and switches it accordingly.

Class Manipulation: The script adds or removes a dark-mode class to the <body> element to apply the theme change.

**🎓 What Have I Learned?**
Building this project helped me improve my understanding of:

Theme Management: Learning how to switch between themes using CSS classes.

DOM Manipulation: Gaining confidence in selecting and updating elements dynamically with JavaScript.

Conditional Logic: Using if/else statements to control application behavior.

Event Handling: Handling user interactions through click events effectively.
